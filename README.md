This stops GoArrow from clearing the dungeon cache.

Download GoArrow.dll and copy it wherever Virindi GoArrow is installed. Something like: C:\Games\VirindiPlugins\GoArrowVVSEdition

Overwrite GoArrow.dll if prompted.

Download Dungeon.Map.Cache.zip and extract the contents to wherever Virindi GoArrow is installed. Something like: C:\Games\VirindiPlugins\GoArrowVVSEdition\Dungeon Map Cache

Overwrite contents if prompted.

Restart AC if it's already open.
